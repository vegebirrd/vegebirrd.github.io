Welcome to **Tori Yasai**’s personal website.

This is a quiet corner on the web where I:  
- Share everyday thoughts and moments from campus life
- Publish notes from classes
- Write reviews on music

## About Me

Hi, I’m **Tori Yasai** — a sophomore at **Peking University**, majoring in **Computer Science** and **Economics**.  
This site is where I drop class notes, daily rambles, and the occasional music review no one asked for but I wrote anyway.  
Thanks for stopping by — have fun exploring!

## About My Nickname

*Tori* means *bird* in Japanese (and, incidentally, is also a fairly common English name), while *Yasai* means *vegetable*. Together, they quite literally spell out *rookie* in Chinese — a playful way to describe myself as a beginner not just in academic fields, but, honestly, in most things in life. After all, I’m still flapping my wings and growing my leaves, trying to figure things out one awkward step at a time.
