Welcome to **Tori Yasai**’s personal website.

This is a quiet corner on the web where I:  
- Share everyday thoughts and moments from campus life
- Publish notes from classes
- Write reviews on music

## About Me

Hi, I’m **Tori Yasai** — a sophomore at **Peking University**, majoring in **Computer Science** and **Economics**.  
This site is where I drop class notes, daily rambles, and the occasional music review no one asked for but I wrote anyway.  
Thanks for stopping by — have fun exploring!

## About My Nickname

*Tori* means *bird* in Japanese (and, incidentally, is also a fairly common English name), while *Yasai* means *vegetable*. Together, they quite literally spell out *rookie* in Chinese — a playful way to describe myself as a beginner not just in academic fields, but, honestly, in most things in life. After all, I’m still flapping my wings and growing my leaves, trying to figure things out one awkward step at a time.

## About Thinks I Like

I like Tigers Blood flavored snow cones — that chaotic mix of strawberry, watermelon, and coconut that nobody can quite explain but somehow just *works*.  
I like Japanese cuisine, especially *sashimi* and *unagi don*.  
I like watching *Mean Girls* for the millionth time and still laughing like I don’t already know every single line (and nursing a big crush on *Regina George* every time).  
I like reading *Sylvia Plath* when I’m feeling dramatic (which is often).  
I like listening to *Radiohead* when I want to sink into my thoughts and let the world blur for a while.  
I like dancing (badly) to *Chappell Roan* like nobody’s watching — even though everyone probably is (but I'm quite an introvert, really).  
I like humming along to *Waxahatchee* when I need something soft and honest to hold onto.  
I like campy outfits that sparkle a little too much, dramatic eyeshadow that probably belongs on a drag stage, and clothes loud enough to start conversations with strangers.
