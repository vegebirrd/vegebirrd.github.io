Welcome to **Tori Yasai**’s personal website.

This is a quiet corner on the web where I:  
- Share everyday thoughts and moments from campus life
- Publish notes from classes
- Write reviews on music

## About Me

Hi, I’m Tori Yasai — a sophomore at Peking University, majoring in Computer Science and Economics.  
This site is where I drop class notes, daily rambles, and the occasional music review no one asked for but I wrote anyway.  
Thanks for stopping by — have fun exploring!
