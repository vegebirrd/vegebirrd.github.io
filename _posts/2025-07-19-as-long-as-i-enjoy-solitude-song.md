[Verse 1]  
I know it takes some courage to fly  
When the ground feels safer, and the clouds too high  
All around me, laughter fills the night  
Confetti, roses, and the blinding light  
  
[Chorus]  
But here in the corner, where I belong  
Quiet and still, I hum my soundless song  
My heart’s a bird that nobody sees  
Dancing alone in the silent breeze  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hands that hold me feel like ice  
A fleeting touch, but it never feels right  
Never the one to step into the glow  
I watch the party from the shadow below  
  
[Chorus]  
But here in the corner, where I belong  
Quiet and still, I hum my soundless song  
My heart’s a bird that nobody sees  
Dancing alone in the silent breeze  
  
[Bridge]  
I see their smiles, their flames collide  
But my little world is calm inside  
Coldness blooms where I stand  
An eternal ally that holds my hand  
  
[Final Chorus]  
Here in the corner, where I belong  
Quiet and still, I hum my soundless song  
My heart’s a bird that nobody sees  
Flying alone through the silent breeze  
Flying alone… and it’s enough for me
