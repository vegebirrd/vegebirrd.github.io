From Waxahatchee to The Smile, from hazy Americana to stripped-down dance music, 2024 gave us a lot to feel.  
These are 10 songs that shaped the sound of my year — not just trends, but echoes that stayed.

## 10. "Beaches" - Beabadoobee

A breezy, nostalgic tune that makes you feel like lying on warm sand, lost in summer memories.  

## 9. "Not Like Us" – Kendrick Lamar

The most talked-about diss track of the year — but also a club anthem, a cultural moment, and a West Coast war drum. Lamar dances and punches at the same time.

## 8. "Espresso" - Sabrina Carpenter

## 7. "Girl so confusing featuring Lorde" - Charli xcx ft. Lorde

A quirky and electrifying pop track, blending Charli’s bold experimentation with Lorde’s haunting elegance.  
  
## 6. "Much Ado About Nothing" - Waxahatchee

Soft-spoken but deeply resonant, this track showcases Katie Crutchfield’s gift for weaving emotion into poetic simplicity.  
  
## 5. "Life is" - Jessica Pratt

Jessica Pratt’s voice floats like a whisper in the dark, and this song feels like a fragile moment captured in amber—a quiet reflection on the impermanence of life.  

## 4. "Mahashmashana" - Father John Misty

A haunting and ceremonial track, where Father John Misty’s poetic depth meets orchestral grandeur, creating a song that feels just like a hymn for the soul.  

## 3. "Right Back to It" - Waxahatchee ft. MJ Lenderman

This song captures the fragile balance of moving forward after a stumble. Its stark imagery—like navigating carefully, step by step—echoes in both Katie’s intimate vocals and Lenderman’s grounded accompaniment, creating a poignant reflection on resilience.  
  
## 2. “Good Luck, Babe!” - Chappell Roan

A shimmering ode to queer joy, this song blends retro pop flair with razor-sharp, delightfully direct lyrics. Chappell’s clever storytelling and unabashed confidence turn every line into a celebration of individuality, wrapped in a glittering, campy package that feels both nostalgic and refreshingly modern.  

## 1. "Bending Hectic" - The Smile

Spanning over eight minutes, this epic composition feels like a cinematic journey. Thom Yorke’s emotive vocals and Greenwood’s Penderecki-style strings create a sweeping narrative, balancing chaos and serenity. The story slowly unfolds, building layers of tension and, finally, explodes, culminating in a breathtaking, otherworldly climax - definitely the greatest musical moment of the year.
