I know it takes courage to fly,  
When you fear the height.  
Around me, laughter, bonds ignite,  
Confetti, roses, and the limelight.  
  
A corner, that's where I belong,  
Silent still, I reach out, to feel that soundless song.  
Heart dancing, like a lone bird of paradise,  
Hands holding, drips of bone-chilling ice.  
  
Never the one to dance in the party's light,  
The crowd's glow, a spectacle I shy.  
In my solitude, a tranquil sight,  
Where coldness blooms, an eternal ally.
