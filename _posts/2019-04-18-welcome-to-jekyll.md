I know it takes courage to fly,
When you fear the height.
Around me, laughter, bonds ignite,
Confetti, roses, and the limelight.

A corner, that's where I belong,
Silent still, I reach out, to feel that soundless song.
Heart dancing, like a lone bird of paradise,
Hands holding, drips of bone-chilling ice.

Never the one to dance in the party's light,
The crowd's glow, a spectacle I shy.
In my solitude, a tranquil sight,
Where coldness blooms, an eternal ally.
