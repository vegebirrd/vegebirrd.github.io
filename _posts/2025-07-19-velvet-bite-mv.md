## [Intro]

velvet velvet velvet bite (Nyeah)  
brat summer, all damn night (Oh fuck)  
velvet velvet velvet bite (Nyeah)  
don’t you pull, but hold me tight (Suno On the Track!)  

---

## [Hook]

touch me without touching — i like it (Nyeah)  
watch me without watching — i like it (Nyeah)  
burn me without burning — i like it (Nyeah)  
learn me without learning — i like it (Nyeah)  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it (Fuck me)  
bite it, don’t bite it, invite it, don’t fight it (yes babe)  
brat summer forever — it’s dripping, don’t hide it (Nyeah)  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it (Oh yes)  

---

## [Verse 1]

you say nothing but your hands confess  
you don’t speak but you undress  
eyes like ropes and a velvet press  
claws in silk, what a quiet mess  
underneath the gold there’s a darker tone  
between the words there’s a little moan  
you pretend you’re cold but your cover’s blown  
and you carve your name into my bone  

---

## [Pre‑Chorus]

so sweet but so unclean  
a little sin beneath the sheen  
your perfume’s stuck between  
my skin and everything unseen  

---

## [Hook]

touch me without touching — i like it (Nyeah)  
watch me without watching — i like it (Nyeah)  
burn me without burning — i like it (Nyeah)  
learn me without learning — i like it (Nyeah)  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it (Nyeah)  
bite it, don’t bite it, invite it, don’t fight it (Nyeah)  
brat summer forever — it’s dripping, don’t hide it (Fuck)  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it (Nyeah)  

---

## [Verse 2]

you leave bruises that don’t appear  
you say “close” but you’re already here  
you plant seeds that won’t grow clear  
you bite down where they can’t hear  
silk and sugar, teeth and lies  
glitter sharp between your thighs  
every brat deserves a prize  
but you only pay in sighs  

---

## [Bridge]

say it softer — i like it (Oh yes)  
cut it rougher — i like it (Oh yes)  
make it longer — i like it (Oh yes)  
make it wronger — i like it (Oh yes)  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it (Oh yes)  
more, more, more — don’t fight it (Oh yes come on)  

---

## [Final Hook]

touch me without touching — i like it (Right)  
watch me without watching — i like it (Right)  
burn me without burning — i like it (Right)  
learn me without learning — i like it (Right)  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it (Right)  
bite it, don’t bite it, invite it, don’t fight it (Right)  
brat summer forever — it’s dripping, don’t hide it (Fuck)  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it (Right)  

---

## [Outro]

velvet velvet velvet bite  
brat summer, all damn night  
velvet velvet velvet bite  
don’t you pull, but hold me tight  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it... (Shout out to A.G.)  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it... (Shout Out to Charli)  
i like it, i like it, i like it, i like it... (Gradually fade out!)
