When the lake was frozen,  
I wished to see, through the ice, the hidden.  
Like birds, fly away, or lie still, ways to be chosen,  
Thrown by God, we were just dice, unbidden.  
  
'How do fish endure the winter's blight?'  
I ponder, 'What mysteries beneath out of sight?'  
Inhaling deeply, finding answers, in this cold night:  
Silent souls dancing in the heath, hearts taking flight.
